# MiGrid
This is a simple CSS Framework to built a responsive layout.
This framework uses the flexbox css property which is already supported by all major browsers. Why use this framework instead of others? Simply because it is lightweight and accompagneted by a tool which allow you to set your
personalized breakpoint for mobile, tablet and desktop. Note that the default breakpoint used by this framework are:
  1) Desktop >= 1024px;
  2) Tablet: 768px <= b <= 1024px;
  3) Mobile: <= 480px;
